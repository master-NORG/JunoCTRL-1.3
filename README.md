# JunoCTRL-1.3
Alpha Juno Hardware Controller

This is the repository for the JunoCTRL Alpha Juno controller from MIDI Club.  You may use these files if you want to make your own JunoCTRL or modify your unit.  Be aware that I wrote the firmware 6 years ago when I knew almost nothing about C++ programming, it's awful to look at.  However, it works well, performs well and is bug-free.

I am not going to spend the time to document this project better, not that I don't want to, I just don't have the time. You're welcome to email me at info@midiclub.net if you have any questions.

Note: there is a second PCB for the JunoCTRL that uses the Aluminium enclosure, I will upload it soon when I get the chance, it's on an external hard drive somewhere.
