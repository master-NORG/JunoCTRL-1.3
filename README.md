# JunoCTRL-1.3
Alpha Juno Hardware Controller

This is the repository for the JunoCTRL Alpha Juno controller from MIDI , which was released in 2015 and slowly upgraded and developed over the years until 2020.  You may use these files if you want to make your own JunoCTRL, modify your unit or would like to make a batch to bring down the price of components.  Be aware that I wrote the firmware 6 years ago when I knew almost nothing about C++ programming, it's awful to look at.  However, it works well, performs well and is bug-free.

I am not going to spend the time to document this project better, not that I don't want to, I just don't have the time. Although MIDI Club is no longer a thing, you can still reach us for questions about this project anytime at midiclub604@gmail.com

Note: there are two pcb boards, the main board and the smaller rear board for the switches, power and midi sockets. If you are making a JunoCTRL with the DIY acrylic case then you only need the main board and not the rear PCB.

Happy hacking!
