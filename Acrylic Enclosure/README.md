JunoCTRL Acrylic Case Files

//In this folder are two files for making an acrylic laser cut case for the JunoCTRL.  They are Adobe Illustrator files and most laser cutting and printing service providers will be able to use these.  You will need to aquire one panel of 3mm thick (very important) matte acrylic and it must be approximately 21" x 12" in size.  I highly recommend using matte acrylic and not glossy, because glossy is too reflective and tends to pick up a lot of fingerprints and dust quickly.

//Printing**  You will need to print the graphics on the acrylic panel first before laser cutting.  The printing must be perfectly aligned since the laser cutting depends on it.  The graphics include a few cross hairs for proper alignment.  So for the type of printing we went with UV printing because it is the least expensive, however UV printing is not as permanent as screen printed graphics, so go with whichever method you prefer, either works fine.  If you do go with UV printing be very careful while transporting the printed panels to make sure the graphics don't get scratched off at any point. You will also notice in the printing file there is a layer that is all white and then the layers with colour, this is because the UV printing on black or dark colours needs a white surface to print on.  So the UV printer will do a layer of white and then the colour layers directly over top of them.

//Laser Cutting**  Most laser cutting service providers will be able to work with the large file, but keep in mind they must align it properly using the hair triggers to calibrate their cut.  The front panel is closet to the top of the file because this part must be cut as straight as possible, the side and rear panels do not need to be as perfect which is why they are near the bottom.

//Final notes** I have occasionally ordered 3mm plastic and received plastic that was 4.5mm thick.  If this is the case you may need to sand down the teeth on the pieces so everything fits.  Be sure the acrylic you order has no more than a +-0.5mm tolerance.
