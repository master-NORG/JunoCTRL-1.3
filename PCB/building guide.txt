1. IC Sockets!  This must be done first before anything
2. Resistors, 220, 2.2K, 470 ohm, 1K, Diodes, Ceramic Capacitors (little yellow guys), tactile buttons
3. Resistor Networks (square yellow things, MUST BE PUT THE CORRECT ORIENTATION)
4. Voltage regulator, Electrolytic Capacitor
5. Side JST PH sockets (white ribbon cable sockets)
6. 6-position rotary switches (two of them, and make sure to put them in the right spot, they are ridiculously expensive)
7. Potentiometers
8. 4-position rotary switches (four of them)
9. Red Leds
10. Header sockets for arduino
11.You are now finished the main board, yay. Now do the back panel PCB.

Back Panel:
1. Start with JST top sockets
2. 2-position and 3-position switches, do not overheat.
3. DC Socket, make sure it's straight and lots of solder
4. Midi Sockets, make sure flush against board

All done, attach the ribbon cable.
